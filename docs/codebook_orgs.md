# Codebook for New York Public Contracts Project (NYPCP) mergedorgs dataset

Reference: Marwell, Nicole P. and Aaron Gullickson.  2016.  New York Public Contracts Project Dataset.

mergedorgs merges data from two different sources.  The first is the
New York Public Contracts Dataset mergedcontracts file, which provides
organization names.  The second is the Business Master File (BMF) from
the Internal Revenue Service, as managed by the National Center for
Charitable Statistics.  The BMF data cover the years 1997-2012, and
were provided by Professor Thad Calabrese of New York University.  The
researchers eliminated all BMF data corresponding to organizations not
included in the mergedcontracts database, and [something on how you
constructed the file with data for each year 1997-2012].  Not all
variables are available for all entries in the dataset.
