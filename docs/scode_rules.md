##Other service area coding decision rules 
* FUND TRAINING PROGRAM / COMPUTER TRAINING PROGRAMS: when I could not see what population these programs serve, based on other programs/contracts I ascertained if the organization tends to serve adults or children and I put the contract either under EDUC for adult education or YOUTH for children/youth education. 
* Contracts like PROGRAM FUNDING, PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT GRANT, FUND PROGRAMS, SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS PROGRAMS, i.e. contracts where program?s nature is not specified my decision strategy was the following: 1) Ascertain organization?s primary focus or profile either from guidestar or other web resources, and assign contract accordingly;? 2) if step 1 is not possible, code it as GEN (general/multi-service) if organization has services/programs that fall into multiple categories; 3) or code it based on the nature of the originating agency 4) if that does not help too much either, code it as GEN (e.g. Dept of Education program funding to CHURCH OF GOD OF PROPHECY) 
* TANF: It stands for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. It is the replacement for AFDC (Families with Dependent Children. It is cash welfare. 1) FSP if prevention, ?making sure that the strains of living of welfare don?t translate into child abuse, child care e.g. TANF PREVENTION PROGRAM,? PRV / TANF; 2) EMPL/EMPO - if welfare, job placement-related: moving people to work, welfare-to-work programs e.g. JOB PLACEMENT & JOB RETENTION SERVICES FOR TANF RECIPIENTS 
* CASP - Consolidated Application for State Administered Programs (see file ?common programs? u EMPO if from Dept of Labor or Office of Mental Health; 
* INDEPENDENCE: FUND INDEPENDENCE GOALS, e.g. Employment program of BROOKLYN COMMUNITY HOUSING AND SERVICES, INC. ? ?Provides short term rentql assistance and long term support services to 70 individuals coming from the New York City Shelter? BUT when related to disabilities, it goes to DIS e.g. INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM of agency BRONX INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES INC. 
* START ? UPs : not to GOS (as we agreed at the beginning), but to respective area 
* family support services if from Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, code it as DIS, if from elsewhere: FSP 
* LOCAL ASSISTANCE / LAO ? Mostly GOS: In Brooklyn all LAO contracts come with Local Assistance (in Bronx they are not always paired). I assume they belong together or LAO stands for Local Assistance, but we do not know that for sure. BUT: if specific programs are named such as DIRECT LOCAL ASSISTANCE BROOKLYN BDSO (DIS); or LOCAL ASSISTANCE RESEARCH OF LEGISLATION REGARDING NOISE POLLUTION (ADV), LAO/JOBS FOR YOUTH (EMPL), put it into specific service area. Nicole: ?Local assistance? is probably a bureaucratic thing? if they seem like general operating grants, put it into GOS 
* 16(B)2, Section 5310, CHAPTER 620 ? transportation services for the disabled or the elderly. Look at what the NPO does in guidestar, figure out its primary focus and decide if DIS or ELD. In cases when it was uncertain, e.g. with churches, I coded it as ELD. 
* To provide recreation ? if it?s from Office of Aging or elderly population is specified, code as ELD, otherwise code as CULTO 
* teaching medical courses and education in hospitals: Though our original decision rule was to put these under GOS, we ultimately decided that some fit out adult education category much better. EDUC: GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY TRAINING; PRIMARY CARE/RESIDENCY TRAINING; INTRO TO MEDICINE; PROVIDE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY - CLINICAL AND???????? PRACTICAL TRAINING; TEACHING COURSE:INTRODUCTION TO MEDICINE; EPIDEMIOLOGY TRAINING. BUT: HEALTH PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT/WORK FORCE TRAINING goes to GOS?? 
? 
Decisions on coding organizations (addresses, OrgIDs) 
* Good rule of thumb: is it program money (code into respective area) or to support the organization (GOS). 
* DBAs or D/B/As (doing business as): Some appear with 2 names in dataset (either in same field or one organization name in the street address field), most commonly they share same address. These should be coded to have the same OrgID, i.e. as same organization. One of the names is usually the incorporation name.) (see DBAs.xls) 
* Multiple-borough organizations ? some organizations appear in more than borough, e.g. Bronx Community College of the City University of New York appears in Manhattan dbase, with Manhattan address. We should make a list of OrgIDs of all these (see sheet 2 in file DBAs.xls). Check if these organizations have the same tax number to ascertain that they are really the same organization. We can change these later. 
* PO Boxes. Make a list of those organizations that only have PO Box addresses, and also the contract amounts, and their OrgIDs and on what kind of contracts these are. Also, change back the addresses to PO Boxes where I tracked them down for post offices. We do not need those.? 
? 
HOSPITALS 
o Beth Israel Medical Center (Manhattan) different than BETH ISRAEL MEDICAL CENTER KINGS HIGHWAY DIVISION in Brooklyn. Code as separate. 
o code CONEY ISLAND HOSPITAL and CONEY ISLAND HOSPITAL HEALTH CORP as same 
?
