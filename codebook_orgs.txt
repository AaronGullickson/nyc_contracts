Codebook for New York Public Contracts Project (NYPCP) mergedorgs dataset

Reference: Marwell, Nicole P. and Aaron Gullickson.  2016.  New York Public Contracts Project Dataset.

mergedorgs merges data from two different sources.  The first is the New York Public Contracts Dataset mergedcontracts file, which provides organization names.  The second is the Business Master File (BMF) from the Internal Revenue Service, as managed by the National Center for Charitable Statistics.  The BMF data cover the years 1997-2012, and were provided by Professor Thad Calabrese of New York University.  The researchers eliminated all BMF data corresponding to organizations not included in the mergedcontracts file, and [something on how you constructed the file with data for each year 1997-2012].  Not all variables are available for all entries in the dataset.
